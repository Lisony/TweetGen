TateTheTalisman,"My brother has received thousands of letters from Muslim supporters around the world.

Not a single Christian has sent me a letter."
TateTheTalisman,"World War 1 is the single saddest period of world history. 

Think life’s bad? Read about WW1. 

Think you’re unlucky? Read about WW1.

Just for the fuck of it, read about WW1. 

Wow."
TateTheTalisman,"That’s enough twitter for today 🙄.

Merry Christmas."
TateTheTalisman,"NO MORE DONATIONS.

One of the links I posted took users inside my donation somehow.

Some joker changed my comment to the child’s family to be rude and abusive and now I am blocked from go fund me.

Whoever you are, I hope you are proud of yourself. 

I was just trying to help. https://t.co/s6FPO15hPx"
TateTheTalisman,"Suggestion from @MariuszMarchel. 

A young Romanian boy with spinal abnormalities needs help. 

(For some reason this shows my donation in pounds. 829 pounds is the same 1000 dollars everybody else is getting). 

Donate here https://t.co/IcKOhzi55H"
TateTheTalisman,"Suggestion from Instagram.

Wow … woman and get 5 children died in a fire. 

This one hit hard.

TateTheTalisman,"It’s Christmas.

Retweet this with a “GoFundMe” link that needs support. 

I’ll go through a few and if I like them I’ll drop 1000 dollars on them.

TateTheTalisman,"Numerologists are stupid. 

I once heard one say “63 is a number which represents youth and longevity, Brad Pitt was born in 1963 that’s why he looks great for his age”. 

In the USA alone 4,098,020 babies were born in 1963.

Are they all youthful now? 

Dumb. Just SO dumb."
TateTheTalisman,"Existing “off grid” is no longer an option.

The only hack is to exist on as many grids as possible.

When scumbag companies like @RevolutApp steal from me I can survive because my international banks won’t.

The War Room made my setup possible.

TateTheTalisman,"I rarely ask for favours from my followers. 

But read this and Retweet if you find it scary.

I hope this never happens to a man who can’t handle it."
TateTheTalisman,"I doubt I’ll ever see this money. To remove a man’s access to all of his money and all banking facilities is a tactic of the matrix. 

I doubt I’ll even get the explanation I asked for.

Luckily I’m hard to kill.

Luckily I have The War Room.

Merry Christmas. https://t.co/9yau7msn31"
TateTheTalisman,"I don’t need likes or attention but IF you’ve found this eye opening please retweet the first tweet of this thread as a warning to your friends and family.

God know how many they do this to and how serious the consequences of these thefts are.

Spread the word #cancelrevolut"
TateTheTalisman,"The point of this was to show the world how insane a matrix attack can be.

You think we only lost socials? Nope. Everybody from banks to Uber to Apple ID was taken.

This is how Kanye lost billionaire status overnight. 

And for what? I once made a joke about women drivers?"
TateTheTalisman,"As many of you are already telling me, every second past 28 days they keep my funds is a crime. 

Credit to @transferwise who blocked my accounts as a matrix attack but actually send me the 500k they had of mine 28 days later. 

Revolut are built different! https://t.co/KduUzTwOwQ"
TateTheTalisman,"I’d like to know who else they’ve done this to and for what? 

Maybe they actually drove real people to suicide, people without large twitter audiences.

Me saying these things to them was to make a point, to show how little they care. 

Luckily for me I don’t need the money. https://t.co/2WMj0oAlHN"
TateTheTalisman,"Suicide is no joke. 

Men kill themselves everyday in the uk, many over financial issues more tame than this one. 

I go full nuclear here!

I wasn’t offered help or anybody to talk to. Keep in mind I’m not even asking for my money now, just for a reason that they’ve done this. https://t.co/sFYccqMkyT"
TateTheTalisman,"How can you tell somebody after 2 months whos claimed to have now lost his home “we are working on it”. 

Obviously I’m fine but that isn’t the point of the thread.

How much money do you have? 10k? 100k? 10m? Its scary as fuck that a “bank” can do this to a person. 🤔 https://t.co/eXFsUZQJtE"
TateTheTalisman,"Here I intensify the lies.

I imagine how this would be if this were some guys life savings. I tell them I need to make payments on my house, that I could lose my home.

More brick walls and “thanks for understanding”

Imagine the effects on a man’s mental health this COULD have? https://t.co/Bg2jChXPfy"
TateTheTalisman,3 days past their promised deadline. https://t.co/6csXmOXqWY
TateTheTalisman,"I got bored for 2 weeks living my life but as the promised 20th was approaching I remembered “that 700k would be nice”… 

I picked up the conversation.

This is when I decided to start going hard. Even then I knew this was above some compliance check. 

The matrix attacks. https://t.co/KeCuRD4Phw"
TateTheTalisman,"My private jet was already booked. 

But imagine you WERE on a family holiday and your bank did this you? Imagine you chased daily to get your funds.

In this hypothetical situation you would now be HOMELESS in Croatia for 1/4 of a year by now.

Pretty cold this time of year too. https://t.co/5sWRVAUGXA"
TateTheTalisman,"Notice the evasiveness in their speech and the constant “thanks for understanding”.

But I don’t understand and I make it very clear in exchanges like this.

How on EARTH could it take nearly a month to work out I’m rich and not a criminal? 

CRB checks take 24 hours. https://t.co/PB6WwVQv6v"
TateTheTalisman,"Two days were up and they demand another 18.

Still no reason was given for their actions, in fact even NOW I’ve not been given an explanation.

This is why its scary, imagine this WAS all your money, your only bank, imagine you had a family? Criminal. 

It gets worse. https://t.co/gXeljoR3mn"
TateTheTalisman,"For those who follow me you’ll know that during this time I was on a mega yacht trip. 

I have plenty of cards and money as do my friends, but I decided to spin a “this is all I’ve got” story to speed them up. 

My lies got much darker but what’s scarier are their replies! https://t.co/8DcmIRUn4U"
TateTheTalisman,"It began in august when I noticed my cards and transfers stopped working. 

I assumed it was because I had been flying around. 

This screenshot is important as I was promised at the end of August “the review might take UP TO 2 calendar days”. 

It gets funnier stay tuned. https://t.co/rYfLony1dA"
TateTheTalisman,"Great ad! I’d like to share my experience with you.

When I got cancelled @RevolutApp locked my account containing over 700,000 dollars.

It’s been locked for 5 months and they have yet to give me a reason. (This is illegal)

Please RT and DO NOT use Revolut.

Updates below.

TateTheTalisman,"What kind of man does this girl take me for?

Frankly I’m offended. https://t.co/Q3AePeLQdj"
TateTheTalisman,"Playing around on the AI photo creator an image was created of me wearing a pink suit. 

I sent the image over to my team on Savile Row and by the time I got to London it was under construction.

Forgive the “baggy” look this is only the first fitting. 

Cutting is a process. https://t.co/w3tZnASk8Z"
TateTheTalisman,"This jackets fabric is encrusted and woven with crushed jade stone … enough of this fabric was made to tailor only 20 suits worldwide. 

Mine is under construction.

That’s the tweet. https://t.co/INYVf711wL"
TateTheTalisman,"Behind every great man are great friends, a great woman and a great tailor.

I’ll post all my tailoring related content under this thread. https://t.co/4KmLKlaIo8"
TateTheTalisman,"Before claiming you’re depressed quit masturbation and the consumption of adult entertainment.

This is a bigger factor in the “mental health crisis” than is ever spoken about.

“Touching yourself is healthy and normal” = Low testosterone.

Why is nobody but me saying this? https://t.co/UdNaW65GC0"
TateTheTalisman,"Giving dogs chemotherapy is animal abuse. 

Humans at least understand why they’re being tortured, dogs can’t make sense of it.

Spoil them for a month then have them put down, it’s cruel and ultimately very selfish to put an animal through that. 

(Yes I own dogs)"
TateTheTalisman,"Unpopular opinion - there is a physical difference in sex with women who have never used sex toys.

Blasting your vagina with battery powered gizmos has a physical effect and men can tell.

I don’t care who this offends."
TateTheTalisman,"Send this to a black or South American girl who needs to hear it …

If society would call a white woman “fat” for being the same size as you, you’re fat too. Stop hiding behind the word “thick”. 

Sincerely, 
Earth"
TateTheTalisman,Retweet for a chance to win 3 dollars and 24 cents.
TateTheTalisman,"Son of one of the greatest black chess masters ever, grandson of a black WWII vet, nobody could be prouder of their African American heritage than I am.

But white liberals can be programmed into believing I’m a racist because I once said men drive better than women?

TateTheTalisman,"Accomplishment honours your ancestors.

My grandfather is long dead, and had I not elevated myself to my current status nobody would see this photo.

How many likes can Emory Andrew Tate, WWII veteran get? 

Fought in the pacific against the Japanese.

Hope he’s proud of me. https://t.co/c9pBA3Pab7"
TateTheTalisman,"It’s not just that @adinross has grown on me, I’d go as far as to call him my friend.

Him and his team are good people and I believe with the right guidance he can be a shining example tothe youth of the world.

Only time will tell."

TateTheTalisman,"I’ve met Jake Paul once and I swear as god as my witness… I wouldn’t hook up with his ex. 

He’s a cool guy, basic bro code. 

Make whatever you will of this tweet, I mean every word."
TateTheTalisman,"So it’s fine to confiscate property from Russian oligarchs because they “obtained their money unfairly”.

Racist.

I put it to you that the average Russian millionaires money is no more “Ill gotten” than Nancy Pelosis.

When will the world seize the assets of western politicians?"
TateTheTalisman,"Money doesn’t make life great.

Money makes life easy.

An easy life can be great if you’ve become hardened through struggle.

An easy life will suffocate and rot the unprepared mind."

TateTheTalisman,"I’m secure enough to post these photos as a reminder that the work must never stop.

Months of physio, two surgeries and a total lack of physical training had me looking like this. 

This is me today just a few months later.

This isn’t “done” it’s just “progress”. Keep watching. https://t.co/mEJjTW1yKI"
TateTheTalisman,"I want to make a public announcement.

Since the shoulder reconstruction earlier this year the rehab as been gruelling, but I am now stronger than ever.

Within 1 year or so I WILL be accused of steroid use.

So I am putting this on the record now.

NO. Never have. Never will. https://t.co/H0tYyVVfDQ"
TateTheTalisman,"Bold and brazen kleptomania is a sign of mental illness.

TateTheTalisman,"If I’m in Dubai and a gorgeous woman messages me saying she’d love to hang out with me I always do the same thing.

I tell her I’m going somewhere cold and boring. “Babe next week I’ll be in Belgium let’s meet there”.

If she says yes, she wants to meet me not just get to Dubai."
TateTheTalisman,"So the little mermaid is black now.

What do you think of my take on it?

TateTheTalisman,"Enough of these Bond movies, we need a series true to the novels. Each book becomes an 8x1 hour series missing no detail.

Set in the original time period, the smoking, the womanising, the distasteful language and the drinking with no punches pulled.

@mgmstudios call my agent. https://t.co/D6s7EzF0an"
TateTheTalisman,"Never forget that the most respected woman in Islam (mentioned in the Quran over 70 times) is “Maryam”.

Or as us Christian’s call her, Mary mother of Jesus Christ who himself is a fundamental figure in the Islamic faith.

Do not tell me there is no common ground to stand on."
TateTheTalisman,"My involuntarily hiatus from twitter has been a time of evolution and growth.

Since vanishing I have grown my net worth by 100 times, sharpened my mind and even had children.

This twitter account will be a beacon for motivation, rationality and truth.

Enjoy the show.
