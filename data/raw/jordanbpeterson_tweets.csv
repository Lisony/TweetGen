jordanbpeterson,"42. Be grateful in spite of your suffering.

There’s some real utility in gratitude. Gratitude is the process of consciously and courageously attempting thankfulness in the face of the catastrophe of life."
jordanbpeterson,"41. Remember that what you do not yet know is more important than what you already know.

It is much better to make friends with what you do not know than with what you do know, as there is an infinite supply of the former but a finite stock of the latter."
jordanbpeterson,40. Write a letter to the government if you see something that needs fixing–and propose a solution.
jordanbpeterson,"...If you do it a third time, then I'll say, ""Hey, I just noticed this. Not only did it happen, but it happened here. And it happened here. So there's something going on here. I'm not ignoring it."""
jordanbpeterson,"39. Don’t let bullies get away with it.

I usually use a rule of three:

If we interact and you do something that I find disruptive, I'll note it.

If you do it again, I think, ""That probably wasn't merely a situation."" I'll leave it be because that's still not enough evidence."
jordanbpeterson,"38. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.

​​When things are not good and hard, you get these little moments where a little bit of possibility still shines through.

You’ve got to take those moments when you get them."
jordanbpeterson,"36. Read something written by someone great.

Carl Jung had an idea that part of personality development is to understand your shadow, the parts of you that you don't want to admit to. You can learn about your shadow by reading history.

A book isn't paper; it's a portal."
jordanbpeterson,"35. Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.

You positively need to be occupied with something weighty, deep, profound, and difficult.

What would your life be like if you made use of all the potential that you were offered?"
jordanbpeterson,"34. Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.

There will be times in your life when it will take everything you have to face what is in front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth so terrible that the only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace it with."
jordanbpeterson,33. Do not transform your wife into a maid.
jordanbpeterson,32. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.
jordanbpeterson,"31. Don’t avoid something frightening if it stands in your way–and don’t do unnecessarily dangerous things.

The gradual exposure to what you’re afraid of is curative. Confront the world forthrightly and expose yourself courageously to things you’re afraid of. Life will improve."
jordanbpeterson,"30. Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order."
jordanbpeterson,"...Then you talk about it, name it, and it goes from this blurry thing into a little monster. It's this precision that enables you to specify it.

Now you can do something about it (it's little, at least) if you can admit to it."
jordanbpeterson,"29. Be precise in your speech.

Let's say that you're having a rough patch in your relationship and you don't know why. The issue is unnameable. Is it real? Well, yes, it's manifesting itself in a physiological discomfort."
jordanbpeterson,28. Dress like the person you want to be.
jordanbpeterson,"27. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

The world is harsh. Should you criticize it? Not until you put yourself together. You have to bring everything you can to bear on your problems before you have any right to stand in judgment about Being itself."
jordanbpeterson,26. Nothing well done is insignificant.
jordanbpeterson,25. And be very careful about rescuing someone who does.
jordanbpeterson,"24. Do not try to rescue someone who does not want to be rescued.

It's a very dangerous activity, and it can easily be counterproductive. The probability that they're going to take you down, compared to you elevating them, is very, very high."
jordanbpeterson,"23. Make friends with people who want the best for you.

You have an ethical responsibility to surround yourself with people who have the courage and faith, and wisdom to wish you well when you've done something good. And to stop you when you're doing something destructive."
jordanbpeterson,"22. Ask someone to do you a small favor so that he or she can ask you to do one in the future.

You don't obsessively keep track of who owes what, when, and why. That's a sign of a degenerating relationship. You do what you can for them, and they do what they can for you."
jordanbpeterson,"21. Treat yourself as if you were someone that you are responsible for helping.

You have a vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. You should take care of, help, and be good to yourself the same way you take care of, help, and be good to someone you love."
jordanbpeterson,"20. Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or artistic achievement.

“We don’t need to get married. We don’t need a piece of paper.” That’s the depth of thought you put into it? You’re not going to mark the occasion with conscious awareness and social celebration?"
jordanbpeterson,"19. Maintain your connections with people.

There is no evidence that the importance of friendship declines in any manner with age."
jordanbpeterson,"18. If old memories still make you cry, write them down carefully and completely.

If you're obsessed with memories of the past (most of them negative), there's a lot of you stuck in the past. Many people have parts of them that are stuck in some traumatic childhood experience."
jordanbpeterson,"17. Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.

You will change. You will start to become one thing, instead of the clamoring multitude you once were. It is far better to become something than to remain anything but become nothing."
jordanbpeterson,"16. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.

The people you compare yourself to you don't know very well. You see a shiny outside but not the reality of their life. Be less concerned with other people's actions. You have plenty to do yourself"
jordanbpeterson,"15. Try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible.

The world presents itself as a series of puzzles. Some of which you’re capable of solving and some of which you’re not.

If you want to change the world, you start with yourself and work outward."
jordanbpeterson,"14. Do not allow yourself to become arrogant or resentful.

If you’re resentful, you’re likely not standing up for yourself sufficiently, or someone is legitimately treading on your territory. You need to do something about that. Or live with the consequences."
jordanbpeterson,"13. Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.

Aim at something profound, noble and lofty. Pick the best target you can conceptualize. Stumble toward it. Notice your errors and misconceptions along the way, and correct them. Confront what stands in your way."
jordanbpeterson,"12. Make at least one thing better every single place you go.

I’m on the side of the person that wants to do something positive with their life. Start by maximizing the quality of your life. Figure out how to do that in a way that’s of benefit to your relatives and community."
jordanbpeterson,"11. Be careful who you share bad news with.

You can tell a true friend bad news, and they’ll listen. They won’t derail the whole conversation about how something worse happened to them once."
jordanbpeterson,"10. Be careful who you share good news with.

You want to share good news with people who will be genuinely happy for you. That’s one way you can identify those people who are on your side."
jordanbpeterson,"9. Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship.

Allow yourself to become aware of what you want and need, and have the decency to let your partner in on the secret. Do not expect the beauty of love to maintain itself without all-out effort on your part."
jordanbpeterson,"8. Listen to them hard enough so that they will share it with you.

The sympathetic responses during a genuine conversation indicate that the teller is valued and that the story being told is important, serious, deserving of consideration, and understandable."
jordanbpeterson,"7. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you need to know.

You want to enter into a conversation so that you come out wiser than you went in."
jordanbpeterson,"6. Pay attention.

What do you do if your life isn’t in order? Pay attention. Paying attention is like watching for something you don’t know. It’s an unbelievably powerful force."
jordanbpeterson,"5. If you have to choose, be the one who does things instead of the one who is seen to do things.

If you fulfill your obligations every day, you don't need to worry about the future."
jordanbpeterson,"3. Act so that you can tell the truth about how you act.

Stop doing things that you know are wrong, that you could stop doing. It might be a little thing. That’s fine. Stop doing it, and see what happens. You strengthen yourself."
jordanbpeterson,"2. Do not do things that you hate.

Watch yourself. If you see that you’re doing things that make you hate yourself, consider the cost of continuing."
jordanbpeterson,"1. Tell the truth… or, at least, don’t lie.

Truth reduces the terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word. Truth is the ultimate, inexhaustible natural resource. It’s the light in the darkness."

jordanbpeterson,Another genius who assumes my presumptive comparative illiteracy proves him both correct and moral.
jordanbpeterson,Just as Nietzsche claimed in his brilliant work on ressentiment. Just as Solzhenitsyn claimed in The Gulag Archipelago. Just as Dostoevsky claimed (in The Devils).
jordanbpeterson,"I don't ""miss"" this. I don't buy it. Any of it. I believe it's technically wrong, in that institutions built on power (compulsion) are intrinsically unstable. I believe it's demoralizing and morally hazardous simultaneously. And I believe it's motivated by resentment."
jordanbpeterson,"The same line of thought runs through Jung's work (and M Eliade, E Neumann, J Campbell). Those thinkers concluded that the hero myth is the foundational narrative."
jordanbpeterson,There is an element of postmodern thought I believe to be true although I think the New England pragmatists following CS Pierce formulated it better: that what fundamentally motivates is what is believed to be true. That's a definition of truth.
jordanbpeterson,So what unites us then? Nothing? Then we fight.
jordanbpeterson,And the insistence that the resultant inequality of groups must be resisted by all means possible including revolution in the service of the oppressed groups

jordanbpeterson,Another brave anonymous warrior. Saying things while safely hiding he would never say to anyone in person.
jordanbpeterson,"Foucault was buying sex with poor boys and raping them in a graveyard. It's not a case of ""everyone has done some bad things."" Try again, with a better rationalization."
jordanbpeterson,"That is not a 20th-century insight. The ancient Egyptians had a god, Set, who embodied power. Specifically: the power that corrupts the state."

You cannot maintain trust in yourself if you lie. You cannot maintain trust in yourself, likewise, if you act in a manner that would require a lie if it was discovered. (2/3)"

jordanbpeterson,"And did you have the principle of ""not doing this unless there was an actual emergency"" in mind? No matter how incompetent and narcissistic I wish you weren't, it's always worse than I feared @JustinTrudeau"
jordanbpeterson,Double down: that's what fools do instead of learning.
jordanbpeterson,He is fighting the invisible demons of his own juvenile imagination @JustinTrudeau
jordanbpeterson,"""now that the emergency is over"" and the retroactive cognitive dissonance reduction begins in earnest. There are none so foolish as those who believe their own lies @JustinTrudeau"
jordanbpeterson,And you've learned to support the unnecessary imposition of the Emergency Act and to justify it post hoc even when it was obviously unnecessary  @AHousefather geez.
jordanbpeterson,"From your perspective: ""experts now confident"". How reassuring. Experts @AHousefather"
